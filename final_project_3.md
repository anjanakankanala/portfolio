# Final Project - Part III

### Since project II, as I began to actually get data together, I found that I had to change the scope of my topic based on what data was available. Initially, I wanted to look at the impact piracy had on revenue, supply, and quality of movies made in India in the pre- and post piracy era of Bollywood films (1960-2010). I later found it hard to find data to show these stories, and therefore narrowed my focus on the change in quality of films in India, and also look a post-only look at how revenue increased in the 1995-2015 period after anti-piracy laws reduced levels of piracy in India.
