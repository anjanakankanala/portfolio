# Final Project - Part III

### Since project II, as I began to actually get data together, I found that I had to change the scope of my topic based on what data was available. Initially, I wanted to look at the impact piracy had on revenue, supply, and quality of movies made in India in the pre- and post piracy era of Bollywood films (1960-2010). I later found it hard to find data to show these stories, and therefore narrowed my focus on the change in quality of films in India, and also look a post-only look at how revenue increased in the 1995-2015 period after anti-piracy laws reduced levels of piracy in India. 

### My call to action initially was simply for the general public to consume less pirated content. The logic is that when people consume pirated content -> revenues fall --> producers make less money and have less incentive to invest well in new films -> results in reduced levels of quality of content. Thus, piracy ends up hurting consumers as well as producers, and everyone involved in the filmmaking process. The reason for picking the topic was to make people aware that them choosing to watch pirated movies hurts them too! 

### However, as I got to the end of the project, I came across a quote by American businessman Gabe Newell on piracy. 

# "The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work. It's by giving those people a service that's better than what they're receiving from the pirates." - Gabe Newell

### This inspired me to include a call to action to filmmakers to make their content easily accessible and affordable. With the advent of streaming platforms, there's a fear amongst producers that revenues will fall due to the subsidized costs of these platforms. However, if they don't embrace the change, it will hurt them anyway. They might as well get on board and be a part of the revolution instead of getting left behind.
