# Final Project - Part III

### Since project II, as I began to actually get data together, I found that I had to change the scope of my topic based on what data was available. Initially, I wanted to look at the impact piracy had on revenue, supply, and quality of movies made in India in the pre- and post piracy era of Bollywood films (1960-2010). I later found it hard to find data to show these stories, and therefore narrowed my focus on the change in quality of films in India, and also took a post-only look at how revenue increased in the 1995-2015 period after anti-piracy laws reduced levels of piracy in India. I took out certain aspects of the story and added new ones. For example, I took out the part where I would provide data on where India ranks on the global scale for how much revenue its films generate. I swapped that for data on different countries which showed that countries with strict piracy laws had more films that won film awards compared to countries with widespread piracy that had a reduction in the number of awards won. 

### My call to action initially was simply for the general public to consume less pirated content. The logic is that when people consume pirated content -> revenues fall --> producers make less money and have less incentive to invest well in new films -> results in reduced levels of quality of content. Thus, piracy ends up hurting consumers as well as producers, and everyone involved in the filmmaking process. The reason for picking the topic was to make people aware that choosing to watch pirated movies hurts them too! 

### However, as I got to the end of the project, I came across a quote by American businessman Gabe Newell on piracy. 

# "The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work. It's by giving those people a service that's better than what they're receiving from the pirates." - Gabe Newell

### This inspired me to include a call to action to filmmakers to make their content easily accessible and affordable. With the advent of streaming platforms, there's a fear amongst producers that revenues will fall due to the subsidized costs of these platforms. However, if they don't embrace the change, it will hurt them anyway. They might as well get on board and be a part of the revolution instead of getting left behind. 

### As far as the designing goes, doing the data visualizations on paper first helped immensely in mapping out visually what I want to convey. I had thought of using mainly bar charts, but with the data on different countries and awards, I used a connected dot plot. Earlier, I would have been lost trying to make a graphic like that and would have stuck to the basic tables and bars, but this course helped me get a little comfortable with playing around with visualizing data in different ways. 

### My takeaways from this project is that 1) finding data isn't easy and 2) it's easy to misuse data to tell the wrong story. For example, when I was trying to find revenue on different movies in the 1950-1960 era, I saw how easy it was to be biased and pick certain movies to tell the story that I want to tell. I will remember this in the future anytime I see a data viz that's telling me something out of the ordinary. That's not to say I will reject, but I've learned through this course to be more aware of what narratives inadvertently get spun in the media.
