# Debt-to-GDP Ratio - An Overview 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7692074"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

### This is a chart of grid lines. On one chart, we get an overview of every country's change in the debt-to-GDP ratio over the years. Each line represents that particular country's change in the ratio between the years 1995 - 2020. When we hover over each of the lines, we see the different ratios through the years. I chose green as the color of the lines because green is associated with money, and this infographic is talking about debt. 

# Debt-to-GDP Ratio - An In-Depth Visualization 
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7692379"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

### This visualization lets us see the change in the debt-to-GDP ratio for every country in a different tab. Every line in the bar chart for each country represents a year from 1995 - 2020. It helps us see the change more clearly over the years and observe upward, downward, or static trends. I chose a shade of purple for this infographic because it is muted, while also being appealing. It does not feel like there is too much of the color on the page, as opposed to how it may have looked had I gone for a brighter color.
