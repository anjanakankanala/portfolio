# **Hello, my name is Anjana Kankanala (She/Her)**

### This portfolio is a collection of my work for the "Telling Stories with Data" class at Carnegie Mellon. 

## About me 

### I am a first-year Master's student in entertainment industry management! If you want to make me instantly happy, send me pictures or videos of dogs.

## What I hope to learn

### I am interested in the way data is shaping decisions made in the entertainment industry today. I hope to learn to visualize data well, and provide meaningful insights to my future employers (yeah, you should definitely give me that job offer.)
