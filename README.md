# **Hello, my name is Anjana Kankanala (She/Her)**

### This portfolio is a collection of my work for the "Telling Stories with Data" class at Carnegie Mellon. 

## About me 

### I am a first-year Master of Entertainment Industry Management student at CMU. I enjoy reading, yoga, travelling, and petting every dog I come across (as much as their humans will allow.) If you want to make me instantly happy, send me pictures or videos of dogs.

## What I hope to learn

### I am interested in the way data is shaping decisions made in the entertainment industry today. With the advent of streaming services, there's plenty of data that companies have on their consumers. I believe that if we can analyze and interpret this data intelligently, we can learn how to be better content creators and know how to engage our audience better. I hope to learn to visualize data well, and provide meaningful insights to my future employers (yeah, you should definitely give me that job offer.)
