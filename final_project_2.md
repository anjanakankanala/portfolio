# Final Project - Part II

## Topic 

### The effect of piracy on the quantity of movies supplied and quality of movies in the Bollywood film industry in India. 

##### With the proliferation of Video Cassette Recorders (VCRs) and largely unregulated cable television in the 1980s, India saw an increase in unpaid airing and viewership of films. With little to no laws against piracy, businesses cropped up selling pirated movies in all langauges. For the purpose of this story, we will look at piracy of Hindi films, known as Bollywood, in India. 

##### We will first look at the entertainment consumption scene in India before VCRs. Then we will look at the impact that piracy had on the revenue generated by the film industry in the period when piracy boomed, ie, 1985 - 2000. We will seek to answer the following questions: 
* Did piracy increase or decrease revenue? 
* Did the volume of new movies being made change in response to piracy? 
* Did the quality of movies change in response to piracy?
